build an efficient model that can predict the overall win and seats covered by a particular party
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and data preprocessing were done before building the models

## Classification Models:
Following models were built and their accuracies were compared.

- Random Forest 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
